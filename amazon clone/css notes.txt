flex box

To Start flex box we need to set property display flex(this is for main container that conatain flex items)

if flex directions is set to row then the main axis is row (lft to right ) and cross axis is column(top to bottom)

if flex directions is set to column then the main axis is column (top to bottom ) and cross axis is row(left to right)

justfy content space around :the side(sapce btwn container boundry and element) sapace is half of space btwn elemnts

justfy content space between :isme (no space between elemnt and container boundry)side space hat jaati hai and sabko equal space aata hai

justfy content space evenly :isme space between elemnt and container boundry are equal and sabko equal space aata hai

align content and align items mainly works on cross axis(if flex directions is set to row then the main axis is row (lft to right ) and cross axis is column(top to bottom))

align self this also works on cross axis(this is property for flex itms not container)

flex wrap is used to wrap multiple elemtn it mainly works when elemnts are present in multiple line

note:justify content works on main axis where align content and align items,align self  mainly works on cross axis

align itmes used for flex container and align self(high priority) used for aling the flex itmes .
